### Situational Overview (Business Need)

> The African Union has hired Batch3 LLC, a data science consultancy, to gather insights from across the continent on  which public health and social measures are most effective at reducing the spread of Covid-19. 

> The contract states that they are looking for evidence-based insights and they want to learn from existing initiatives launched a competition for all Young African Data Scientists to provide evidence-based insight on the effectiveness of recent public health government policies in the continent as it relates to Covid-19. 

> The contract wants Batch 3 LLC to investigate the following countries to identify which interventions had the most effect on the country under study.
